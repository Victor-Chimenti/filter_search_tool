# Education Abroad Program Web Hosted Application
An application that displays, sorts, searches and filters programs for the Seattle University Education Abraod Department
## Display Sort Filter Search Tool
This is first application of this sort I did for the University. I did this work over the summer of 2019 and it launched that fall. Since this application went live, the Marketing and Communcation Department has received numerous requests for me to make a similar and customized version of this application for their department needs.<br>
Currently I have 3 active projects that descend from this and one already live and completed project that originally inherited this code base.
### Tech Stack
I like working in fundamental technologies because those skill translate easily to high level frameworks.
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS
